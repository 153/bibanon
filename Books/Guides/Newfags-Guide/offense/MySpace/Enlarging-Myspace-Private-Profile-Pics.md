Faced with a Myspace private profile when trying to get a good image for your [dox](/dox)? Even though you can't view the account, you can still get a larger copy of the profile image, perfect to add to your dox of someone. In this example I'll use Tom Anderson, the founder of Myspace, although he he has an ungodly number of friends on his account here: [myspace.com/tom](http://www.myspace.com/tom) he also maintains a private account: [myspace.com/tomanderson](http://www.myspace.com/tomanderson).
