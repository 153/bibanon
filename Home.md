The **[[Bibliotheca Anonoma]]** is a Git [[Gollum]]-based wiki designed to collect and safeguard the most important and interesting data from the internet, as well as make the best of it readable and accessible for netizens even while offline.

We aspire to create a task force that will create a Library of Alexandria for the internet, collecting and cultivating information that would have otherwise been lost to the sands of time. Why? In the spur of the moment, few have bothered to save the data that made the internet worth fighting for in the first place. Such data is notoriously fragile while on the changing landscape of the internet. History is made, but quickly forgotten, and people's stories are told once and never revisited again. 

To prevent such a fate, the Bibliotheca Anonoma has a special feature: The ability to download the entire wiki for offline view, or rehosting, using git for revision control.

We need your help and contribution to succeed.

Because of the huge scale of this wiki, the responsibilities of the wiki are divided into multiple teams with overlapping interests. There's an internet history team, general web content crawling team, history team, technology team, even an internet folklife team. Contribute to the one you feel the most interested in.
