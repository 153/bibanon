This is where it starts to get good. OP decided to use actual writing instead of greentext, and plot development became a concern. /b/ knew about this new story, and caps\pastebins were made of the thread, aiding OP's publisher. So, let's begin.

### The actual story

Today actually started pretty normally - as normal as possible when the first thing  you see is your sister in the bathroom, brushing her teeth wearing nothing but knickers. Actually, the thing first I experienced was my mother rapping on my bedroom door.

“Tasha are you in there again? You need to get ready for school! Plus, young lady, you're getting a bit old to be getting in with your brother every night. Honestly, you might as well move in for all the night you end up in there...”

Her nagging voice trails off, Tasha stirs gets up on one elbow and kisses me on the cheek.

“Morning," she gives my bum a squeeze and gets out of bed, luckily still wearing her PJs. A few minutes later I realise I need a piss, that's when I walk in on her. She spots me in the mirror, arches her back to puff out her tits, blows me a kiss and does the neck-piss-off-jerk thing as mum is still on the same floor, and it would appear unseemly if I go in for a grope/snog/rub and we were interrupted.

As you know, mother loves to leave me lists of things to do during the day to pay for room and board until I find a job. This has been going on for quite a while to the point where I can now pre-empt pretty much what she's going to ask me to do, so if I get far enough ahead, I can get a sneaky day off. Today was such a day, so as soon as mother left the house to do the inane shit she gets up to, I got the fuck out of Dodge and went to the cinema for a morning showing of Die Hard.

Boy oh boy was that money well spent. Our cinema is a bastard for mobile phone signals, and depending on your service provider and where you sit, you can have no signal whatsoever, or you get it in lumps. The movie was about halfway through when my phone buzzed (I’m considerate enough to turn the fucking sound off) and I see 4 missed calls and 7 texts, but they're from my mother, who never calls me unless she wants me to do something she can't be arsed to do, and she has never texted me in her life.  I actually never knew she knew how to. The cinema is pretty empty, and the film is proper shit, so I scroll through the texts.

_Why aren't you at home?_
_Why aren’t you answering your phone?_
_Can you call me?_
_Please call me_
_Are you getting these messages?_
_Please don't ignore me this is important_
_Your sisters had an accident_

I spit out my coke, abandon my shitty popcorn and leap down the steps 3 at a time,  I am not out of the auditorium before I’ve called mum.

“Mum what’s happened? Where's Tasha”

“Where the hell have you been? I’ve been calling for an hour”

“The signal’s rubbish, I am in the garden mum, you know this. Anyway, what’s happened?”

“Something happened at school, Tasha's been taken to hospital. That’s all I've been told. One of her friends and one of the staff are up there with her,” I'm in the car park, completely forgetting where I've parked the poxy car.

“OK, I'm on my way there now. When are you getting there?" I find the car and get in.

“Can you go and see her? I can't really get away...” The tone of her voice irritates me most.

“What do you mean you can't get away? Where are you?”

“I’m at Muriel's. I can't just leave right now, it would be awkward?”

“Awkward. Your fucking daughter is in hospital and you're worried about your fucking image?!”

“How Dare y..” if you could slam down the receiver on a mobile phone I would have. I'll deal with the shit later. I start up the car and I’m just about to set off when I realise I don't actually know which hospital Tasha is at.

The cinema is by a motorway junction and there are two A&E hospitals in a 30 mile radius. I don't know what's happened to her, and depending on WHAT has happened dictates which hospital she goes to. I'm staring at my phone, trying to swallow my pride and call my mother when the phone rings. It’s Tasha. I can't control my thumbs as I tap accept.

“Tasha?” All l hear is sobbing.

“No... no it's Amanda. I'm at the hospital, she's been hurt. It was my... was my...”

“Amanda, Amanda... which hospital?”

“It was my fault! l didn't see her!!" She's getting hysterical, I hear shushing sounds in the background,

“Amanda? Where are you?” A voice comes on the phone and tells me the location. I don't ask who the new voice belongs to. I hang up and break several laws gelling to the hospital. The hospital has a pay car park, but my parents have very good lawyers, so fuck'em. l run through the car park and barge into  reception. Calming myself l ask for my sister's location and the receptionist points me in the right direction. The hospital's like a  maze, but it's not long before l turn into a corridor where l see Amanda standing perfectly still with her back to me, phone still in her hand. l say her name, and although I’ve never actually met her, I’ve seen pictures. She’s obviously seen some of me as when she turns to face me, she wails and starts sobbing, just a picture of misery. There's a man standing beside her, obviously the voice l heard on the phone, trying to comfort her by lamely patting her on the shoulder, and he doesn't look like a teacher. l walk towards Amanda and put my arms around her. She buries her face in my chest and it's just one continuous cry of despair. l think she's trying to talk but l can't understand a word she's saying. l turn to the man standing there like a lemon.

“You're from the school?”

“Caretaker” (Janitor)

“Caretaker? No offence, but you’re all they could spare? What’s happened anyway?” He shrugged apologetically.

"Sorry, l was just asked to be the responsible adult until someone from Tasha's family turned up. l know as much as you.  I'm sorry, but as you're here l have to get back. The school asked, could you let them know how she is as soon as you know?", and with that he leaves. Fucking fantastic. Amanda's calming down a bit as l hug her, and l lead her over to a chair and get her to sit down.

“What’s going on?" She's clutching a wad of tissues in her other hand, they’re already soaking wet but she still uses them to wipe her face. In between the sobs, she manages to tell me that just before midday, they had PE. Today was hockey. If you’re not aware, British schoolgirl's hockey can be fucking brutal. At one point a member of their opposing team hit the ball with some force up the pitch, rendering it airborne at head height. Both Amanda and Tasha went for the ball at the same time, Tasha got there but stumbled. Amanda brought her hockey stick back to hit the ball, just as Tasha rose from her fall. The ball hit Tasha on the cheekbone at the same time as Amanda’s hockey stick hit her with full force on the back of her head. She went down and smacked the back of her head again on the ground. I’m just fucking numb. l sit there for what seems like an eternity, holding hands with Amanda to keep her calm. Nothing is said, and no one attends to us except to see if we want drinks or more tissues for Amanda. Eventually someone approaches us and tells me l can see her.

"What about Amanda?"

"Sorry, family only."

“She is family." We're led a little down the corridor and into a room, where all my birthdays have come at once. Tasha's sitting up in bed and very awake. No tubes, no wires. She looks up and manages a smile. She's got a huge wad of bandage taped to her cheek, and a bandage around her head. I'm elated but again, Amanda bursts into floods of tears.

“I'm so sorry! l didn't know you were there!”, she walks over to the bedside while l talk to the man who let us in. Despite the seeming severity of what happened, she got off lightly. She regained consciousness not long after she was admitted and has been improving ever since. There's a tiny fracture on her cheekbone, which doesn’t need fixing, and the back of her head was badly cut, but they've stitched it well, although the area will have bruising for weeks. Two inches lower could have snapped her spine. l always said hockey was dangerous. Tasha's talking softy to Amanda, who seems to have stopped crying. I join them and the conversation here is all niceties, broken when my mother walks in the door. She shoots me a look and I return the favour, but at least she seems to show genuine concern for Tasha. l back away slightly and Amanda comes over to stand beside me.

“You OK?" She sniffs a nod. I suddenly realise she's not in what I know is their uniform, it's a pale blue t-shirt and rather short dark blue shorts. She's wearing knee and elbowpads.

"Is that your gym kit?”. She looks down.

”Oh crap, all my clothes are at school!”

“Don't worry; sure they’ve got all your stuff together. l need to call them anyway to let them know how she's doing.” l whip out my phone, find the number and have a conversation with the receptionist.

“Well, they've got all your stuff together,but they’re expecting you back in class this afternoon.”

“What?!”

“That’s what they said. Nice school you go to!"

“Oh, brilliant. How am I going to get back? My parents are both at work.”

“It's OK, I'll take you." She smiles. It's a distractingly petty smile, at least better than all that sorrow she had earlier. Just then mother calls over, it appears she’s been listening.

“Well, don’t be long, just popping out to inform your father what’s happened. We'll have a chat about your language at home later,” and she leaves, the doctor or whatever just after, leaving just the three of us in the room. Amanda looks embarrassed but Tasha has a knowing smile on her face. She looks at the girl beside me.

“Didn't take you long.” I look at Amanda and we must have matching confused expressions. Tasha points between us. We look down and that's when I realise Amanda and l are holding hands. It’s not the comforting ‘4 fingers holding 4 fingers’ hand hold either. Our fingers are intertwined, I didn’t realise we’d done it, and I don’t think Amanda did either, but for some reason, we don’t break the hold. In fact Amanda holds my hand tighter. It’s a little awkward but Tasha’s still smiling. I break the silence.

“Amanda needs to get back to school, and I’ve said I’ll take her. Mum should be back soon... hopefully," Tasha adopts a fake pouty expression, I’ve seen it before a hundred times.

“Oh, fine! Leave me here all alone!” But the expression soon fades, I think it hurts to piss around. I ask Amanda to wait outside for a while so I can say goodbye. As the door closes, I turn to Tasha and she’s got a huge grin on her face.

“I knew you’d like her!” I’m now confused as fuck.

“Yeah.. she’s nice, but we.. I mean we..” She gets that look on her face.

“What did we agree yesterday? This can’t last forever. I’m 14, Amanda’s the same age but she’s not related to you. We can still enjoy ourselves, but she’s a better long term prospect.”

“Better long term prospect? We were only holding hands!”

“I know, but look, what we’ve got is great, I love it when we do stuff to each other, but we can’t do it forever. And anyway, I don’t want you to abandon me straight away, we’ve only just started having fun!” and she pulls me towards her and we kiss. Nothing too strenuous, she’s still covered in bandages and I don’t want to break her. I feel a flutter of her tongue as we part lips, just as mother re-enters the room.

“Are you going then? That girl’s looking bored.” Classy as ever.

“Yes, I’ll see you both later.” As I reach the door I look back. Mother is fussing with something in the corner of the room, Tasha quickly looks over at her, then to me, before raising her hospital gown to show me her knickers and bare boobs. She tries to stifle a laugh but it quickly transforms into ‘ow ow ow owwwwww!’ as the laughter obviously hurts her injuries. I join Amanda outside, she grabs my hand, intertwines her fingers with mine and we leave the hospital.

We don’t speak as we walk through the corridors to the car park. I think she’s still in shock, as she holds on to my hand for dear life. I find the car (no parking ticket) and we get in. The drive to her school will take about fifteen minutes, and the silence is awkward. Looking over at her she’s staring out of the window. I think she’s crying again.

“Tasha’s going to be fine, you saw her.” She nods but she’s still upset. I reach over to put a reassuring hand on her leg. The awkwardness factor increases as too late I remember she’s wearing very short shorts and I put my hand on her bare thigh. She doesn’t seem to care.

“Hey, are you going to be alright?” She nods again, and finally speaks.

“I keep hearing the sound it made when I hit her, and I keep seeing her hit the ground.” I give her leg a gentle squeeze.

“It was an accident, Amanda. It happens. Stuff like this happens all the time. When we get out remind me to show you my leg.” She stops staring out of the window and turns to me.

“Why?”

“About 4 years ago, playing football (soccer), someone gave me a pretty nasty tackle, snapped my  shin-bone. Had to have a steel rod put in there while it set.” (true)

“Ow”

“Yep, pretty much what I said at the time” This raises a smile, so I take my hand off her leg and change gear. She moves one of her hands to where mine just was. Probably coincidence. Still, she’s cheered up slightly as we pull into the school car park.

I walk with her to reception (after showing her my knackered shin), and tell the receptionist who I am, and that I’ve just brought Amanda back. The receptionist tells her to take her time getting changed, and she can rejoin her classes when she’s ready. She gives me a smile, touches my arm and walks away. I can’t help finally noticing her figure as she leaves. Taller than Tasha by at least six inches. Blond hair, but shorter and dirtier than my sister’s, and my eyes are drawn to the wiggle of her backside as she walks. I remember where I am and snap out of it. Looking at rear ends in an all-girl’s school is probably frowned upon. I thank the receptionist and turn to leave when she stops me.

“Actually, the headmaster did say he wanted to see you when he got the chance.”

“Me? Why?”

“I don’t actually know, but Tasha was in his office for a while the other day so it might be something to do with that. His office is just down the hall, I’ll let him know you’re here”

It’s very odd being in an all-girl school when you’re a hormonal teenage guy, made more awkward by all the glances I get from the passing pupils. I went to a mixed secondary and I know the girls there dressed more conservatively. I guess with there being no boys to distract them they have a more liberated approach to their educational environment, it also appears that the bra-optional rule doesn’t just apply to A-cupped girls. I have to concentrate fixedly on the wall straight ahead to avoid staring at the jiggling sweater puppies of all sizes that pass my way. I find the headmaster’s office and knock. No answer so I wait outside. Again, avoiding eye and chest contact with the passing, giggling teenagers. Suddenly a couple that pass do a double-take, then come up to me.

“Aren’t you Tasha’s brother?”

“Um… yes?”

“How is she? It looked awful. Has Amanda come back yet? She was horrified. It was an accident but she was hysterical, insisted on travelling in the ambulance with her...” I fielded the questions as best I could, until the headmaster turns up with the customary ‘aren’t you supposed to be in class?’. He shakes my hand, beckons me into the office, and after promising to pass on the girls’ well-wishes, I follow him in.

The head sat down and after asking how Tasha was, told me that my sister had asked that I be the ‘next of kin’ in the case of an emergency. I wasn’t sure what he meant, but basically Tasha had requested that should anything like what happened today, happen again, I would be the first person contacted instead of my parents.

“Sadly, despite her very eloquent request, I’m afraid we can’t do as she says. It’s a legal thing. I hope you understand.” I do, but I’m not entirely sure why I’m here.

“The reason I wanted to speak to you is because your sister’s request worried me. Is everything OK at home?” I’ve had this question asked of me a few times at school, normally when I was flunking something. 

“It depends on how you define ‘OK’.”

“What do you mean?”

“My father provides for us all, but we only see him at weekends, but he and my mother generally spend weekends away. ‘Rekindling the old fires’, or something. My mother dotes after our little brother, but treats Tasha like a robot. When she eventually gets home from whatever brunch she’s attending, she’s got Tasha learning languages, piano, violin. She only gets free time at weekends, when the parents are away and it’s just me and her. Plus our brother, but he goes to bed quite early, so it’s just us.. chilling.”

“And you get on well with your sister?” 

“Of course, we’re very close, always have been.” He nods, but there’s a hint of something in his expression I’m not 100% comfortable with.

“She speaks very highly of you, you know. I surmised as much about your family situation from what your sister told me. If there’s anything I can say positively about your... situation is that despite appearances, you have a very stable household, and Tasha is thriving. You know she’s been pre-accepted for university?” I nod.

“She’s a veritable sponge for information, and despite appearances, what your mother is doing will hold her in very good stead for the future. As long as she does indeed get some free time?" the sentence ended as a question.

“Oh, yeah. She’s free to do what she wants at weekends, but she generally spends them at friends’ houses”

“Like Amanda?”

“Yes, quite often”

“Good, good. They’re quite alike, those two. Probably why they hit it off so quickly. How is she, by the way? I understand she was the one who...”

“Yes, she’s... better. She was fairly shaken up but I think I, I mean she’s calmed down a lot.”

Suddenly, there’s a knock on the door, but before the headmaster can respond the door bursts open and Amanda comes rushing in, in her full uniform, and throws herself towards me as I stand up. She’s sobbing again, and I wrap my arms around her like before and try to comfort her as much as possible.

“Sorry headmaster, but she’s in no fit state to continue here today.” I’m assuming the woman at the door is one of her teachers.

“I don’t know why she came back at all after what happened.” She stares daggers at me so I feel pressured to defend myself.

“I called earlier and was told Amanda had to come back to classes” The woman and the headmaster exchange a look. I think someone’s overstepped the mark (receptionist, I reckon). He comes over to us and puts a hand on her shoulder.

“Amanda, take the rest of the week off. You need time to recover from this. Don’t worry about your  school work, I’m sure we can figure something out.” She nods her head against my chest, her teacher hands me her bag, the headmaster thanks me for our talk. He doesn’t seem like a bad type, despite the stuffiness of the surroundings. I shift Amanda to my side and we walk back out to the car. A few pupils come up to us and whisper to her, she nods and briefly holds their hands as we pass.

I help her back into the passenger seat, and once I get in and close the door, she’s off again.

“Hey, hey. What did I say earlier? Tasha’s fine.” But she looks at me with tears streaming down her face.

“My hockey stick has still got her blood on it” We sit in the car for a bit as she calms down. I’m fuming they didn’t at least clean the blood away, but we can bollock the school about that later. I ask her where she wants to go, but it’s only just afternoon and no-one’s home. 

“Do your parents know what’s happened?” She shakes her head and pulls her phone out of her bag. She taps a few buttons on the screen but quickly stifles a sob and hands the phone to me.

“You tell them, I can’t” Awkward again. I manage to introduce myself to her mother, tell her what’s happened, she sounds more concerned for Tasha than my mother did. She sounds a little annoyed that her daughter’s been given two days off school, as she probably can’t get the time off work at short notice without pissing off her boss. I offer to look after Amanda until the normal time she gets home, just to ease the obvious tension. Her mother seems a little wary, but I tell her we’ll probably go back up the hospital anyway. She says thank you and I hang up.

“Right, I’m looking after you for the rest of the day, then I’ll take you home later. Sound ok?” She smiles and nods. The drive home is a little more cheerful. Knowing she’s got a couple of days off school has probably lifted her spirits, so we talk bollocks until I pull into our driveway. 

I let Amanda into the house and point her towards the living room. I pick up the hallway phone and call the hospital and ask to speak to Tasha, surprisingly, they put me through (Most private wards have phones these days. Progress for ya).

“Amanda’s with me, she couldn’t handle being back at school so she’s got a couple of days off”

“Didn’t you take her home?”

“No-one home until later, I spoke to her mother, I’m looking after her for a few hours until they get home.”

“That’s really sweet of you. Tell her if she needs anything she knows where my stuff is. Tell her to help herself”

“OK, thanks. We’ll get sorted and come back over to see you”

“Leave it a couple of hours, mum’s telling everyone how to do their job and I, apparently, need a nap.”

“Where’s Tommy (baby brother)?”

“She’s dropped him off at Aunt Xxxxx’s house, She’s having him overnight.”

“Ok, cool. We’ll wait a couple of hours then come up”

“Ok, my body will be waiting” 

“Pardon??” Concussed and still a wise-arse

“I’m just kidding, stupid.” Her voice drops to a whisper “But I still want you”

“I know, Love you sis”

“Love you” We hang up. I go through to the living room and Amanda’s sitting on the sofa, staring at her hands. 

“Tea?” She gives me a soggy smile and nods.

“We’ll go up the hospital in a couple of hours, Tasha’s having a sleep, so we’ve got some time to kill.” I point to a bookcase stacked with DVDs and Blu-rays.

“Unless you’re a Jeremy Kyle fan, there’s bugger all on TV so you can pick one to watch if you like.”

“Got any Twilight?” I give her a look, she cracks a wobbly smile. "Kidding!" She gets up to peruse the shelves and I walk to the kitchen to put the kettle on. After about a minute she calls through.

“What’s ‘Inner Space’?” I’ve finished the tea so bring the mugs through. I hand her her cup and take the DVD case off her. 

“Christ, I haven’t watched this in years. This film’s older than me. 80’s, old school. Practical effects, none of this CGI bollocks they cram into every movie these days. The effects should compliment the film, not tell the story for it.”

“You sound like an old man!” 

“It’s my dad’s fault. Most of these are his, and most of them are older films…” I put the film on and we sit on the sofa to watch it, but we’re still discussing movies for so long (she’s taking media studies at school) that we actually miss the first 10 minutes so I have to start again.
 
“Ugh! Sorry, I should have said I don’t take sugar”

“Sorry, My fault. Tasha does so I thought.. never mind, I’ll get you another one.” I return with her unsweetened tea to notice she’s taken her socks and shoes off, and curled up on one end of the sofa straight in front of the TV. I hand her her cup again and move to sit on one of the single chairs.

“I don’t bite.” She motions towards the other end of her sofa (It’s a 3-seater, so there’s room to spare, but I sit a respectable distance away. I think she doesn’t want to be in a sterile environment) We sit in silence watching the movie. I honestly haven’t seen it in about 5 years but it’s all flooding back to me now. After a while I happen to look over to Amanda and her head’s resting on the side of the sofa. I can’t see her eyes so I can’t tell if she’s asleep or not. Her breathing seems quite deep, so I assume she has. I move to get up but she murmurs “Don’t go” and presses her feet against the side of my leg. I don’t know if she’s still awake or half asleep or what, so I stay where I am, turn the TV down a bit and just sit there as her feet find a comfortable position pressing against my thigh.

I’m actually getting into the movie (It is rather good, I highly recommend it) when Amanda twitches. She’s laying down away to my right, her feet on my right thigh. Her left arm moves quite erratically, I’m a little concerned until I realise she’s just trying to scratch the back of her leg. I let her get on with it and watch the movie when I’m suddenly aware of a lightening in the peripheral vision of my right eye. I look down and see that when Amanda finished scratching her leg, she moved her hand up and across her belly, but she took most of her skirt with her, so since she took her socks off, I’m gazing at a few feet of bare, unclothed skin, and as my eyes follow the shapely contours of her leg, I can’t help but notice she doesn’t appear to be wearing any underwear.

I’m staring. She’s managed to bunch up her skirt in such a way it might as well be a belt running over the top of her hip. Her knees are brought up at right angles to her body and it’s bare ankle all the way up to bare buttock, and I can’t help but look. Looking up at her face, I can tell she’s asleep purely by the sound of her breathing. I’ve spent enough time laying awake watching Tasha sleeping beside me to know when someone’s faking. Still, I’m curious as to whether or not she’s got any knickers on (who wouldn’t be?) so I lean to my left to see if I can see any sign of material. Eventually I make out the material 
covering her privates, so I figure she’s wearing a thong. My curiosity satisfied I reach over and try to grab the hem of her skirt to bring it down again, but she’s got it bunched in her fist, so I  leave it. The little devil on my shoulder tells me it’s not cold in here, and she seems comfortable, so why not enjoy the view?

I hate that little bastard sometimes because he’s normally right. So as the sounds of Jack Putter getting smashed on southern comfort in Tuck Pendleton’s house play in the background, I’m sitting on a comfortable sofa, gazing at the bare bum of my sister’s best friend for several minutes. I could reach out and touch it, but I won’t. I’m actually happy just to look. I know she does as much sport as Tasha, so her legs are as toned as my sisters’. Naturally, I start pitching a tent in my jeans, and as it starts to become uncomfortable, I shift slightly, which makes her move her top leg up slightly, showing me more of her thong. It’s not a solid material, in fact it’s pretty see-thru, and I can clearly make out her slit through the fabric. My dick’s really getting hard so I try to get up but the foot that’s still against my thigh pushes against me, telling me her subconscious still wants my company. It’s getting intolerable in my trousers so I check she’s still genuinely asleep, undo my button and zip, and let my dick out for some air. The pressure’s off so I can relax a little, but I can’t help but look at her incredible legs.

Before I realise it I’m wanking myself off at the sight of her nearly–bare bum and the sight of her slit beneath her knickers. It’s all I can do to stop myself from grabbing her arse cheek before I can feel myself nearing climax. I grab some Kleenex from the box on the small table beside the chair and come hard into a wad of tissues. I give myself a few minutes to calm down, wipe myself off and put my dick back In my pants. I manage to extricate myself fromher feet, dash upstairs for a blanket and place it over her. I don’t try to move her skirt, but I do take another long look at her curvaceous backside before I cover it over. Half an hour later, she wakes up. I have moved to another chair so I say hello so she’s knows I’m still there. She blinks and stares around the room, then notices the blanket over her. She looks under the blanket and untangles her hand from her skirt, blushing as she realises what she’d been showing me before I covered her over.

“Thank you. Sorry”

“It’s ok, and don’t be sorry, you were well out of it.”

“I missed the film”

“That’s ok, you can watch it again any time. Borrow it if you want”

“Thanks” a pause. “Was I flashing my bum?”

“Not really. Flashing implies you gave a quick glimpse.” It takes her a while before she puts her hand over her mouth in horror.

“I’m so sorry” I have no idea why

“Don’t be. I didn’t look, if you’re asking. I tried to cover you up but you had hold of your skirt, and I tried to move but your feet wouldn’t let me. So I just watched the movie.” 

“But you got me a blanket”

“Yes, I waited until you were asleep enough for me to move, them went up and got you the blanket”

“How long did that take?” (quick maths in my head, wanking + erotic source material X proximity to source = time)

“About 10 minutes?” Again, the look of horror, but not quite as pronounced.

“Ten minutes? I was showing you my bum for 10 minutes?” She’s gone beetroot red and I can see her getting more uncomfortable, so I try to cheer her up and calm her down.

“Hey, for what it’s worth, it’s the nicest bum I’ve ever been forced to sit next to against my will for ten minutes.” She smiles.

“Against your will? You mean it was torture?”

“You have absolutely no idea.” I deliberately drop in the double meaning, but I hope she only gets one of them. She blushes again, but it’s a good blush this time. She seems to me softening after her traumatic experience, and for some reason, talking about her body seems to be key.

“Actually, it was quite a while before I realised you actually had anything on down there.” A look of confusion, then realisation.

“Oh, right. I always wear them when we have PE. Those shorts aren’t very flattering if you’ve got big knickers on. You get lumps.”

“But you’re an all girls school, why should you care about lumps? Who’s going to be checking out your backside?” She picks up her cup of tea (which must be stone cold) and takes a sip. She must like it tepid.

“It’s not a fashion thing, it’s a comfort thing.” Fair enough. Naked bum conversation over, I check the time and we decide to head back to see my sister. I make sure Amanda’s got everything we need, and in a brainwave, I ask her to grab a few things that Tasha might need. I doubt mother’s been home. So we pop back up to her room and Amanda goes through her drawers picking out clean underwear, a few t-shirts, clothing for when she gets let out, her iPad and a book that’s laying on her bedside cabinet. All things that I wouldn’t have picked out at all, except her knickers. I pride myself in knowing my sister’s underwear preferences, even before we started fiddling with each others bits. She packs everything in a holdall, I lock up the house and we walk to my car. We get back to the hospital half an hour later. There’s a nurse standing outside Tasha’s room, she tells us it’s ok to go in, but she’s having her dressings changed. We go in, my mother’s there as well.

“Tasha? We’re back.” She raises a hand and wiggles her fingers at us in a mini-wave.

“Gimme a sec, they’re nearly done, I think.” The nurse changing the bandage at the back of her head removes the old one, showing me for the first time the damage. Amanda really did a good job of slicing her head open. There’s a 4-inch line covered in butterfly stitches at the base of her skull, in the middle of a shaved section of her hair. It’s quite dramatic but it looks like you wouldn’t notice it when her hair’s down. Amanda’s holding my hand again but also clutching my arm. I can see the look of horror on her face as she also sees what she’d done. She seems to be holding it together as the nurse places the new bandage on her head, fastening it with micropore tape. It’s when Tasha turns round that Amanda breaks down again. Tasha’s right check isn’t sporting the puffy wad of bandage like before, but it is sporting several more butterfly stitches, and a swelling that’s about the size of a golf ball. No exaggeration, it’s huge. She smiles at us but her look changes to one of concern once she notices Amanda’s got upset again, Tasha holds out her arms and Amanda lets go of my hand, rushing around the bed and crying into Tasha’s shoulder.

“Oh, for pity’s sake. Doesn’t that girl ever stop whining?” This was my mother.

“Mum, she’s upset because she thinks she nearly killed Tasha”

“Well, she did. I’ve half a mind to sue the school you know. Letting them play dangerous sports like that.”

“Dangerous sports? It’s hockey. Football’s just as bad. Remember my leg?”

“Well, they should have been supervised better, and maybe that silly girl wouldn’t have…” 

I lose it.

I’ve put up with this shit for 5 years and I go absolutely mental at her. Her indifference to Tasha’s injuries is one thing, but I’m not having her ripping on Amanda when she’s clearly still in shock. I honestly cannot remember the specifics of what I screamed at her, but I do remember the look of fear on her face as I bore down on her, forcing her into a high-backed chair in the corner of the room. It’s this look that makes me back off. I actually apologise for going off the rails, but it’s obviously been building for a while. I sit down on the end of the bed, drained. Glancing to my left I see Tasha looking just as scared at my rantings, and Amanda looking like she’d rather be anywhere but here right now.
 
We’re sitting in silence. I’m staring at my Mother, and I realise how much Tasha takes after her. Hair same colour (but styled 
like someone in their 50’s), same blue eyes. She doesn’t actually look that much older either, but I guess that’s the  make-up
and spa visits.

“Why do you hate me?” It’s a childish question that would normally sound more apt coming from a stroppy teenager.

She shakes her head. “I don’t hate you” It’s a whisper. 

“But I can’t remember the last time we did anything together, apart from when you’re telling me what to do every day before you piss off and spend all day with your chums.”

“I really don’t hate you, but I can’t stand to be near you.” 

“What the hell does that mean?” She starts crying, not as much as Amanda has been lately, but it’s still awkward. Sod it, I want answers. She looks over at Tasha, says “I’m sorry my darling.” Then turns to me.

“I’m 31.”

I must be slow on the uptake, as I the only thing I can think is ‘what the fuck does your age have to do with anything?’, but the sharp intake of breath from Tasha means she’s figured something out quicker than me, as usual. My turn for the chess face. 

“But I thought you were 36, or 37”

“I’m sorry, we lied to you. It was easier that way” It finally clicks.

“31? But that means you would have been 13 or so when you had me.” She looks down at the floor, shaking her head.

“no, I never had you.”

“What?”

“I’m not your mother.”

When I was 5, my father was driving on the M6 outside Birmingham when we were involved in a crash. My mother, my real mother, died when the truck on the inside lane had a blow-out and ploughed into the passenger side of our car. My head was cut by flying glass. I still have the scar. My father was left to look after me by himself. He managed ok for a while, but trying to juggle his position at work and being a single parent started weighing on him. Eventually, he advertised for a live-in nanny/AU pair. 

A young lady with a baby of her own applied for the position. My father wasn’t completely ok with having two children to look after instead of one, but apparently I took to the baby immediately so the decision was made. The living situation became more comfortable and my father started to dote on the little girl, just as the woman began to dote on me, and weekend socialising meant the parents became close. Tasha’s mother eventually convinced my father to take a holiday, as his workload meant that while he loved and provided for us, he never really spent any time with us except at weekends, so we all took a holiday to Gran Canaria. It’s here that my father proposed. It had been two years since my mother’s death, and certain promises were made not to say anything to us until we were old enough to understand. I guess me ripping on my ‘mother’ was the breaking point.

I’m stunned. I am sitting on the end of the bed but I have no idea what to think or do. I feel a hand reach towards mine and I grasp Tasha’s hand, holding onto some semblance of normality. She’s crying softly, and Amanda’s a wreck.

“That’s the saddest thing I’ve ever heard.” And she comes around the bed to sit beside me. I look at the woman sitting in the chair and she’s the same picture of misery Amanda was a few hours ago. I should hate her, but if what she’s said was true, I can’t feel that way about someone who, despite these new facts, has been my mother for the last 13 years. Still something bugs me.

“Mum” She gasps and looks up, I don’t think she expected me to be calling her that again any time soon. “I get why you did what you did, and I’m grateful, I really am, but I don’t understand why you don’t want to have anything to do with me.” She shakes her head sadly. 

“I can’t tell you. Not now. It might be hard for you to understand, but..”

But I don’t know what the ‘but’ is as at that point my father bursts in the door. He’s left work early to see Tasha. He nods to mum, pats me on the shoulder, doesn’t give Amanda a second glance and walks around the bed to see Tasha. He visibly winces when he sees her cheek, but recovers quickly, kissing her on the forehead he asks all the necessary questions to find out what happened. Amanda’s got off the bed and is standing behind me, anticipating the part when he finds out about her involvement. He looks at her briefly, and she grasps my arm again, but my dad’s a sensible bloke, and after the whole story 
has been relayed he simply says:

“Always said Hockey’s bloody dangerous.”

He turns to Amanda. “Are YOU ok?” She nods, grateful she’s not getting a tongue lashing. “Just an accident. Has her brother told you about his leg? Thought so, He’s always showing his scars off.” He takes a moment to look around the room, and while his arrival changed the mood of the room, it’s dropped again, something he’s good at picking up.

“Something else happened?” Mum tells him that she’s told us about what happened all those years ago, and his shoulders sag. My father’s a large man, it’s where I get my height from, but he looks remarkably small right now. Inexplicably, he takes his work laptop out of his bag, puts it on the over-bed table, powers it up and after a few clicks, he turns it round. There’s a photo of a beautiful dark-haired woman with brown eyes on the screen. Dad starts talking about my real mother, and he talks for quite a while. Over the next hour we all talk to each other, clearing the air, sometimes shouting, a few tears. Amanda’s still with us but I just know she really doesn’t want to be. I hint on the unanswered question but apparently now isn’t the right time for it. I check my watch and it’s gone half 3.
 
“I think I need to be taking Amanda home. Her mother should be back by now.” I stand up and Amanda grabs her bags. I give Tasha a kiss on the good cheek. Give my dad a manly hug, then turn to face mother. She’s finally let her hair out of that ridiculous bun on the back of her head and as she stands up I realise how stupid I’ve been to never spot it before. If Tasha has a habit of looking 11, my mother could easily pass for 20. She gives me an apologetic smile and seems surprised when I go over and give her a hug. I can’t remember the last time I held her and by the tightness of the way she hugs me, I guess she’s 
missed it too. Eventually we break apart, I kiss her cheek and we say goodbye. The drive to Amanda’s house was quiet. I had so much stuff going on in my head I hardly noticed if Amanda actually said anything to break the silence, all I remember was her reassuring hand on my leg and my hand on top of hers. 

We get to her house and her mother meets us outside. Amanda rushes to her and they hug on the doorstep. 

“Thank you for looking after her. How’s she been?”

“She’s better now, but she was shaken up for a while.” Amanda darts into the house leaving me there with her mother.

“It was an accident,” I say “but she’s still blaming herself. Seeing Tasha at the hospital was helping, until.. well, I should be going.” Her mother grabs her purse.

“Oh, please, let me give you something for your trouble, you’ve been so helpful today, really.” But I wave her down.

“No, please, it was my pleasure (thinking back, it really was). I wouldn’t dream of taking anything for it.” But she holds out a £20.

“Petrol fund then.” I smile, say thank you and pocket the cash. 

“Thank you again. So she’s got tomorrow off as well?”

“Yes, the headmaster thought it would be for the best.” I spot the look of mild annoyance on her face. I guess she’s not looking forward to pulling a sickie tomorrow morning. “Look, if it’ll help you, I can look after her again tomorrow. She can chill at our house and we’ll probably end up visiting Tasha again.” The look of relief on her face is poorly hidden.

“Would you? I really don’t mean to impose, but it would be difficult to get the time off…”

“Think nothing of it. Did you want me to pick her up or…?”

“No, I’ll drop her off at yours about 8-ish?”

(*for those that might think I have ulterior motives, our families have known each other for years, and Amanda is always sleeping over, so ner)

“Sounds good.” Amanda comes back out as her mother thanks me and goes back in. 

“You and me again tomorrow kiddo.” This brings a welcome smile again.

“Really?”

“Yep, but I have some things to do at home so you’ll probably end up watching movies all day.”

“Good, I can get to watch that movie again.”

“Yes, and I’ll be elsewhere so I don’t have to stare at your arse for 2 hours.” She blushes but smiles.

“Thanks for everything today. You’ve been really nice.”
