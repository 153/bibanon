This is where it starts to get good. OP decided to use actual writing instead of greentext, and plot development became a concern. /b/ knew about this new story, and caps\pastebins were made of the thread, aiding OP's publisher. So, let's begin.

### The actual story

Today actually started pretty normally - as normal as possible when the first thing  you see is your sister in the bathroom, brushing her teeth wearing nothing but knickers. Actually, the thing first I experienced was my mother rapping on my bedroom door.

“Tasha are you in there again? You need to get ready for school! Plus, young lady, you're getting a bit old to be getting in with your brother every night. Honestly, you might as well move in for all the night you end up in there...”

Her nagging voice trails off, Tasha stirs gets up on one elbow and kisses me on the cheek.

“Morning," she gives my bum a squeeze and gets out of bed, luckily still wearing her PJs. A few minutes later I realise I need a piss, that's when I walk in on her. She spots me in the mirror, arches her back to puff out her tits, blows me a kiss and does the neck-piss-off-jerk thing as mum is still on the same floor, and it would appear unseemly if I go in for a grope/snog/rub and we were interrupted.

As you know, mother loves to leave me lists of things to do during the day to pay for room and board until I find a job. This has been going on for quite a while to the point where I can now pre-empt pretty much what she's going to ask me to do, so if I get far enough ahead, I can get a sneaky day off. Today was such a day, so as soon as mother left the house to do the inane shit she gets up to, I got the fuck out of Dodge and went to the cinema for a morning showing of Die Hard. Boy oh boy was that money well spent. Our cinema is a bastard for mobile phone signals, and depending on your service provider and where you sit, you can have no signal whatsoever, or you get it in lumps. The movie was about halfway through when my phone buzzed (I’m considerate enough to turn the fucking sound off) and I see 4 missed calls and 7 texts, but they're from my mother, who never calls me unless she wants me to do something she can't be arsed to do, and she has never texted me in her life.  I actually never knew she knew how to. The cinema is pretty empty, and the film is proper shit, so I scroll through the texts.

_Why aren't you at home?_
_Why aren’t you answering your phone?_
_Can you call me?_
_Please call me_
_Are you getting these messages?_
_Please don't ignore me this is important_
_Your sisters had an accident_

I spit out my coke, abandon my shitty popcorn and leap down the steps 3 at a time,  I am not out of the auditorium before I’ve called mum.

“Mum what’s happened? Where's Tasha”

“Where the hell have you been? I’ve been calling for an hour”

“The signal’s rubbish, I am in the garden mum, you know this. Anyway, what’s happened?”

“Something happened at school, Tasha's been taken to hospital. That’s all I've been told. One of her friends and one of the staff are up there with her,” I'm in the car park, completely forgetting where I've parked the poxy car.

“OK, I'm on my way there now. When are you getting there?" I find the car and get in.

“Can you go and see her? I can't really get away...” The tone of her voice irritates me most.

“What do you mean you can't get away? Where are you?”

“I’m at Muriel's. I can't just leave right now, it would be awkward?”

“Awkward. Your fucking daughter is in hospital and you're worried about your fucking image?!”

“How Dare y..” if you could slam down the receiver on a mobile phone I would have. I'll deal with the shit later. I start up the car and I’m just about to set off when I realise I don't actually know which hospital Tasha is at. The cinema is by a motorway junction and there are two A&E hospitals in a 30 mile radius. I don't know what's happened to her, and depending on WHAT has happened dictates which hospital she goes to. I'm staring at my phone, trying to swallow my pride and call my mother when the phone rings. It’s Tasha. I can't control my thumbs as I tap accept.

“Tasha?” All l hear is sobbing.

“No... no it's Amanda. I'm at the hospital, she's been hurt. It was my... was my...”

“Amanda, Amanda... which hospital?”

“It was my fault! l didn't see her!!" She's getting hysterical, I hear shushing sounds in the background,

“Amanda? Where are you?” A voice comes on the phone and tells me the location. I don't ask who the new voice belongs to. I hang up and break several laws gelling to the hospital. The hospital has a pay car park, but my parents have very good lawyers, so fuck'em. l run through the car park and barge into  reception. Calming myself l ask for my sister's location and the receptionist points me in the right direction. The hospital's like a  maze, but it's not long before l turn into a corridor where l see Amanda standing perfectly still with her back to me, phone still in her hand. l say her name, and although I’ve never actually met her, I’ve seen pictures. She’s obviously seen some of me as when she turns to face me, she wails and starts sobbing, just a picture of misery. There's a man standing beside her, obviously the voice l heard on the phone, trying to comfort her by lamely patting her on the shoulder, and he doesn't look like a teacher. l walk towards Amanda and put my arms around her. She buries her face in my chest and it's just one continuous cry of despair. l think she's trying to talk but l can't understand a word she's saying. l turn to the man standing there like a lemon.

“You're from the school?”

“Caretaker” (Janitor)

“Caretaker? No offence, but you’re all they could spare? What’s happened anyway?” He shrugged apologetically.

"Sorry, l was just asked to be the responsible adult until someone from Tasha's family turned up. l know as much as you.  I'm sorry, but as you're here l have to get back. The school asked, could you let them know how she is as soon as you know?", and with that he leaves. Fucking fantastic. Amanda's calming down a bit as l hug her, and l lead her over to a chair and get her to sit down.

“What’s going on?" She's clutching a wad of tissues in her other hand, they’re already soaking wet but she still uses them to wipe her face. In between the sobs, she manages to tell me that just before midday, they had PE. Today was hockey. If you’re not aware, British schoolgirl's hockey can be fucking brutal. At one point a member of their opposing team hit the ball with some force up the pitch, rendering it airborne at head height. Both Amanda and Tasha went for the ball at the same time, Tasha got there but stumbled. Amanda brought her hockey stick back to hit the ball, just as Tasha rose from her fall. The ball hit Tasha on the cheekbone at the same time as Amanda’s hockey stick hit her with full force on the back of her head. She went down and smacked the back of her head again on the ground. I’m just fucking numb. l sit there for what seems like an eternity, holding hands with Amanda to keep her calm. Nothing is said, and no one attends to us except to see if we want drinks or more tissues for Amanda. Eventually someone approaches us and tells me l can see her.

"What about Amanda?"

"Sorry, family only."

“She is family." We're led a little down the corridor and into a room, where all my birthdays have come at once. Tasha's sitting up in bed and very awake. No tubes, no wires. She looks up and manages a smile. She's got a huge wad of bandage taped to her cheek, and a bandage around her head. I'm elated but again, Amanda bursts into floods of tears.

“I'm so sorry! l didn't know you were there!”, she walks over to the bedside while l talk to the man who let us in. Despite the seeming severity of what happened, she got off lightly. She regained consciousness not long after she was admitted and has been improving ever since. There's a tiny fracture on her cheekbone, which doesn’t need fixing, and the back of her head was badly cut, but they've stitched it well, although the area will have bruising for weeks. Two inches lower could have snapped her spine. l always said hockey was dangerous. Tasha's talking softy to Amanda, who seems to have stopped crying. I join them and the conversation here is all niceties, broken when my mother walks in the door. She shoots me a look and I return the favour, but at least she seems to show genuine concern for Tasha. l back away slightly and Amanda comes over to stand beside me.

“You OK?" She sniffs a nod. I suddenly realise she's not in what I know is their uniform, it's a pale blue t-shirt and rather short dark blue shorts. She's wearing knee and elbowpads.

"Is that your gym kit?”. She looks down.

”Oh crap, all my clothes are at school!”

“Don't worry; sure they’ve got all your stuff together. l need to call them anyway to let them know how she's doing.” l whip out my phone, find the number and have a conversation with the receptionist.

“Well, they've got all your stuff together,but they’re expecting you back in class this afternoon.”

“What?!”

“That’s what they said. Nice school you go to!"

“Oh, brilliant. How am I going to get back? My parents are both at work.”

“It's OK, I'll take you." She smiles. It's a distractingly petty smile, at least better than all that sorrow she had earlier. Just then mother calls over, it appears she’s been listening.

“Well, don’t be long, just popping out to inform your father what’s happened. We'll have a chat about your language at home later,” and she leaves, the doctor or whatever just after, leaving just the three of us in the room. Amanda looks embarrassed but Tasha has a knowing smile on her face. She looks at the girl beside me.

“Didn't take you long.” I look at Amanda and we must have matching confused expressions. Tasha points between us. We look down and that's when I realise Amanda and l are holding hands. It’s not the comforting ‘4 fingers holding 4 fingers’ hand hold either. Our fingers are intertwined, I didn’t realise we’d done it, and I don’t think Amanda did either, but for some reason, we don’t break the hold. In fact Amanda holds my hand tighter. It’s a little awkward but Tasha’s still smiling. I break the silence.

“Amanda needs to get back to school, and I’ve said I’ll take her. Mum should be back soon... hopefully," Tasha adopts a fake pouty expression, I’ve seen it before a hundred times.

“Oh, fine! Leave me here all alone!” But the expression soon fades, I think it hurts to piss around. I ask Amanda to wait outside for a while so I can say goodbye. As the door closes, I turn to Tasha and she’s got a huge grin on her face.

“I knew you’d like her!” I’m now confused as fuck.

“Yeah.. she’s nice, but we.. I mean we..” She gets that look on her face.

“What did we agree yesterday? This can’t last forever. I’m 14, Amanda’s the same age but she’s not related to you. We can still enjoy ourselves, but she’s a better long term prospect.”

“Better long term prospect? We were only holding hands!”

“I know, but look, what we’ve got is great, I love it when we do stuff to each other, but we can’t do it forever. And anyway, I don’t want you to abandon me straight away, we’ve only just started having fun!” and she pulls me towards her and we kiss. Nothing too strenuous, she’s still covered in bandages and I don’t want to break her. I feel a flutter of her tongue as we part lips, just as mother re-enters the room.

“Are you going then? That girl’s looking bored.” Classy as ever.

“Yes, I’ll see you both later.” As I reach the door I look back. Mother is fussing with something in the corner of the room, Tasha quickly looks over at her, then to me, before raising her hospital gown to show me her knickers and bare boobs. She tries to stifle a laugh but it quickly transforms into ‘ow ow ow owwwwww!’ as the laughter obviously hurts her injuries. I join Amanda outside, she grabs my hand, intertwines her fingers with mine and we leave the hospital.
