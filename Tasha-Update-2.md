This is where it starts to get good. OP decided to use actual writing instead of greentext, and plot development became a concern. /b/ knew about this new story, and caps\pastebins were made of the thread, aiding OP's publisher. So, let's begin.

### The actual story

Today actually started pretty normally - as normal as possible when the first thing  you see is your sister in the bathroom, brushing her teeth wearing nothing but knickers. Actually, the thing first I experienced was my mother rapping on my bedroom door.

“Tasha are you in there again? You need to get ready for school! Plus, young lady, you're getting a bit old to be getting in with your brother every night. Honestly, you might as well move in for all the night you end up in there...”

Her nagging voice trails off, Tasha stirs gets up on one elbow and kisses me on the cheek.

“Morning," she gives my bum a squeeze and gets out of bed, luckily still wearing her PJs. A few minutes later I realise I need a piss, that's when I walk in on her. She spots me in the mirror, arches her back to puff out her tits, blows me a kiss and does the neck-piss-off-jerk thing as mum is still on the same floor, and it would appear unseemly if I go in for a grope/snog/rub and we were interrupted.

As you know, mother loves to leave me lists of things to do during the day to pay for room and board until I find a job. This has been going on for quite a while to the point where I can now pre-empt pretty much what she's going to ask me to do, so if I get far enough ahead, I can get a sneaky day off. Today was such a day, so as soon as mother left the house to do the inane shit she gets up to, I got the fuck out of Dodge and went to the cinema for a morning showing of Die Hard.

Boy oh boy was that money well spent. Our cinema is a bastard for mobile phone signals, and depending on your service provider and where you sit, you can have no signal whatsoever, or you get it in lumps. The movie was about halfway through when my phone buzzed (I’m considerate enough to turn the fucking sound off) and I see 4 missed calls and 7 texts, but they're from my mother, who never calls me unless she wants me to do something she can't be arsed to do, and she has never texted me in her life.  I actually never knew she knew how to. The cinema is pretty empty, and the film is proper shit, so I scroll through the texts.

_Why aren't you at home?_
_Why aren’t you answering your phone?_
_Can you call me?_
_Please call me_
_Are you getting these messages?_
_Please don't ignore me this is important_
_Your sisters had an accident_

I spit out my coke, abandon my shitty popcorn and leap down the steps 3 at a time,  I am not out of the auditorium before I’ve called mum.

“Mum what’s happened? Where's Tasha”

“Where the hell have you been? I’ve been calling for an hour”

“The signal’s rubbish, I am in the garden mum, you know this. Anyway, what’s happened?”

“Something happened at school, Tasha's been taken to hospital. That’s all I've been told. One of her friends and one of the staff are up there with her,” I'm in the car park, completely forgetting where I've parked the poxy car.

“OK, I'm on my way there now. When are you getting there?" I find the car and get in.

“Can you go and see her? I can't really get away...” The tone of her voice irritates me most.

“What do you mean you can't get away? Where are you?”

“I’m at Muriel's. I can't just leave right now, it would be awkward?”

“Awkward. Your fucking daughter is in hospital and you're worried about your fucking image?!”

“How Dare y..” if you could slam down the receiver on a mobile phone I would have. I'll deal with the shit later. I start up the car and I’m just about to set off when I realise I don't actually know which hospital Tasha is at.

The cinema is by a motorway junction and there are two A&E hospitals in a 30 mile radius. I don't know what's happened to her, and depending on WHAT has happened dictates which hospital she goes to. I'm staring at my phone, trying to swallow my pride and call my mother when the phone rings. It’s Tasha. I can't control my thumbs as I tap accept.

“Tasha?” All l hear is sobbing.

“No... no it's Amanda. I'm at the hospital, she's been hurt. It was my... was my...”

“Amanda, Amanda... which hospital?”

“It was my fault! l didn't see her!!" She's getting hysterical, I hear shushing sounds in the background,

“Amanda? Where are you?” A voice comes on the phone and tells me the location. I don't ask who the new voice belongs to. I hang up and break several laws gelling to the hospital. The hospital has a pay car park, but my parents have very good lawyers, so fuck'em. l run through the car park and barge into  reception. Calming myself l ask for my sister's location and the receptionist points me in the right direction. The hospital's like a  maze, but it's not long before l turn into a corridor where l see Amanda standing perfectly still with her back to me, phone still in her hand. l say her name, and although I’ve never actually met her, I’ve seen pictures. She’s obviously seen some of me as when she turns to face me, she wails and starts sobbing, just a picture of misery. There's a man standing beside her, obviously the voice l heard on the phone, trying to comfort her by lamely patting her on the shoulder, and he doesn't look like a teacher. l walk towards Amanda and put my arms around her. She buries her face in my chest and it's just one continuous cry of despair. l think she's trying to talk but l can't understand a word she's saying. l turn to the man standing there like a lemon.

“You're from the school?”

“Caretaker” (Janitor)

“Caretaker? No offence, but you’re all they could spare? What’s happened anyway?” He shrugged apologetically.

"Sorry, l was just asked to be the responsible adult until someone from Tasha's family turned up. l know as much as you.  I'm sorry, but as you're here l have to get back. The school asked, could you let them know how she is as soon as you know?", and with that he leaves. Fucking fantastic. Amanda's calming down a bit as l hug her, and l lead her over to a chair and get her to sit down.

“What’s going on?" She's clutching a wad of tissues in her other hand, they’re already soaking wet but she still uses them to wipe her face. In between the sobs, she manages to tell me that just before midday, they had PE. Today was hockey. If you’re not aware, British schoolgirl's hockey can be fucking brutal. At one point a member of their opposing team hit the ball with some force up the pitch, rendering it airborne at head height. Both Amanda and Tasha went for the ball at the same time, Tasha got there but stumbled. Amanda brought her hockey stick back to hit the ball, just as Tasha rose from her fall. The ball hit Tasha on the cheekbone at the same time as Amanda’s hockey stick hit her with full force on the back of her head. She went down and smacked the back of her head again on the ground. I’m just fucking numb. l sit there for what seems like an eternity, holding hands with Amanda to keep her calm. Nothing is said, and no one attends to us except to see if we want drinks or more tissues for Amanda. Eventually someone approaches us and tells me l can see her.

"What about Amanda?"

"Sorry, family only."

“She is family." We're led a little down the corridor and into a room, where all my birthdays have come at once. Tasha's sitting up in bed and very awake. No tubes, no wires. She looks up and manages a smile. She's got a huge wad of bandage taped to her cheek, and a bandage around her head. I'm elated but again, Amanda bursts into floods of tears.

“I'm so sorry! l didn't know you were there!”, she walks over to the bedside while l talk to the man who let us in. Despite the seeming severity of what happened, she got off lightly. She regained consciousness not long after she was admitted and has been improving ever since. There's a tiny fracture on her cheekbone, which doesn’t need fixing, and the back of her head was badly cut, but they've stitched it well, although the area will have bruising for weeks. Two inches lower could have snapped her spine. l always said hockey was dangerous. Tasha's talking softy to Amanda, who seems to have stopped crying. I join them and the conversation here is all niceties, broken when my mother walks in the door. She shoots me a look and I return the favour, but at least she seems to show genuine concern for Tasha. l back away slightly and Amanda comes over to stand beside me.

“You OK?" She sniffs a nod. I suddenly realise she's not in what I know is their uniform, it's a pale blue t-shirt and rather short dark blue shorts. She's wearing knee and elbowpads.

"Is that your gym kit?”. She looks down.

”Oh crap, all my clothes are at school!”

“Don't worry; sure they’ve got all your stuff together. l need to call them anyway to let them know how she's doing.” l whip out my phone, find the number and have a conversation with the receptionist.

“Well, they've got all your stuff together,but they’re expecting you back in class this afternoon.”

“What?!”

“That’s what they said. Nice school you go to!"

“Oh, brilliant. How am I going to get back? My parents are both at work.”

“It's OK, I'll take you." She smiles. It's a distractingly petty smile, at least better than all that sorrow she had earlier. Just then mother calls over, it appears she’s been listening.

“Well, don’t be long, just popping out to inform your father what’s happened. We'll have a chat about your language at home later,” and she leaves, the doctor or whatever just after, leaving just the three of us in the room. Amanda looks embarrassed but Tasha has a knowing smile on her face. She looks at the girl beside me.

“Didn't take you long.” I look at Amanda and we must have matching confused expressions. Tasha points between us. We look down and that's when I realise Amanda and l are holding hands. It’s not the comforting ‘4 fingers holding 4 fingers’ hand hold either. Our fingers are intertwined, I didn’t realise we’d done it, and I don’t think Amanda did either, but for some reason, we don’t break the hold. In fact Amanda holds my hand tighter. It’s a little awkward but Tasha’s still smiling. I break the silence.

“Amanda needs to get back to school, and I’ve said I’ll take her. Mum should be back soon... hopefully," Tasha adopts a fake pouty expression, I’ve seen it before a hundred times.

“Oh, fine! Leave me here all alone!” But the expression soon fades, I think it hurts to piss around. I ask Amanda to wait outside for a while so I can say goodbye. As the door closes, I turn to Tasha and she’s got a huge grin on her face.

“I knew you’d like her!” I’m now confused as fuck.

“Yeah.. she’s nice, but we.. I mean we..” She gets that look on her face.

“What did we agree yesterday? This can’t last forever. I’m 14, Amanda’s the same age but she’s not related to you. We can still enjoy ourselves, but she’s a better long term prospect.”

“Better long term prospect? We were only holding hands!”

“I know, but look, what we’ve got is great, I love it when we do stuff to each other, but we can’t do it forever. And anyway, I don’t want you to abandon me straight away, we’ve only just started having fun!” and she pulls me towards her and we kiss. Nothing too strenuous, she’s still covered in bandages and I don’t want to break her. I feel a flutter of her tongue as we part lips, just as mother re-enters the room.

“Are you going then? That girl’s looking bored.” Classy as ever.

“Yes, I’ll see you both later.” As I reach the door I look back. Mother is fussing with something in the corner of the room, Tasha quickly looks over at her, then to me, before raising her hospital gown to show me her knickers and bare boobs. She tries to stifle a laugh but it quickly transforms into ‘ow ow ow owwwwww!’ as the laughter obviously hurts her injuries. I join Amanda outside, she grabs my hand, intertwines her fingers with mine and we leave the hospital.

We don’t speak as we walk through the corridors to the car park. I think she’s still in shock, as she holds on to my hand for dear life. I find the car (no parking ticket) and we get in. The drive to her school will take about fifteen minutes, and the silence is awkward. Looking over at her she’s staring out of the window. I think she’s crying again.

“Tasha’s going to be fine, you saw her.” She nods but she’s still upset. I reach over to put a reassuring hand on her leg. The awkwardness factor increases as too late I remember she’s wearing very short shorts and I put my hand on her bare thigh. She doesn’t seem to care.

“Hey, are you going to be alright?” She nods again, and finally speaks.

“I keep hearing the sound it made when I hit her, and I keep seeing her hit the ground.” I give her leg a gentle squeeze.

“It was an accident, Amanda. It happens. Stuff like this happens all the time. When we get out remind me to show you my leg.” She stops staring out of the window and turns to me.

“Why?”

“About 4 years ago, playing football (soccer), someone gave me a pretty nasty tackle, snapped my  shin-bone. Had to have a steel rod put in there while it set.” (true)

“Ow”

“Yep, pretty much what I said at the time” This raises a smile, so I take my hand off her leg and change gear. She moves one of her hands to where mine just was. Probably coincidence. Still, she’s cheered up slightly as we pull into the school car park.

I walk with her to reception (after showing her my knackered shin), and tell the receptionist who I am, and that I’ve just brought Amanda back. The receptionist tells her to take her time getting changed, and she can rejoin her classes when she’s ready. She gives me a smile, touches my arm and walks away. I can’t help finally noticing her figure as she leaves. Taller than Tasha by at least six inches. Blond hair, but shorter and dirtier than my sister’s, and my eyes are drawn to the wiggle of her backside as she walks. I remember where I am and snap out of it. Looking at rear ends in an all-girl’s school is probably frowned upon. I thank the receptionist and turn to leave when she stops me.

“Actually, the headmaster did say he wanted to see you when he got the chance.”

“Me? Why?”

“I don’t actually know, but Tasha was in his office for a while the other day so it might be something to do with that. His office is just down the hall, I’ll let him know you’re here”

It’s very odd being in an all-girl school when you’re a hormonal teenage guy, made more awkward by all the glances I get from the passing pupils. I went to a mixed secondary and I know the girls there dressed more conservatively. I guess with there being no boys to distract them they have a more liberated approach to their educational environment, it also appears that the bra-optional rule doesn’t just apply to A-cupped girls. I have to concentrate fixedly on the wall straight ahead to avoid staring at the jiggling sweater puppies of all sizes that pass my way. I find the headmaster’s office and knock. No answer so I wait outside. Again, avoiding eye and chest contact with the passing, giggling teenagers. Suddenly a couple that pass do a double-take, then come up to me.

“Aren’t you Tasha’s brother?”

“Um… yes?”

“How is she? It looked awful. Has Amanda come back yet? She was horrified. It was an accident but she was hysterical, insisted on travelling in the ambulance with her...” I fielded the questions as best I could, until the headmaster turns up with the customary ‘aren’t you supposed to be in class?’. He shakes my hand, beckons me into the office, and after promising to pass on the girls’ well-wishes, I follow him in.

The head sat down and after asking how Tasha was, told me that my sister had asked that I be the ‘next of kin’ in the case of an emergency. I wasn’t sure what he meant, but basically Tasha had requested that should anything like what happened today, happen again, I would be the first person contacted instead of my parents.

“Sadly, despite her very eloquent request, I’m afraid we can’t do as she says. It’s a legal thing. I hope you understand.” I do, but I’m not entirely sure why I’m here.

“The reason I wanted to speak to you is because your sister’s request worried me. Is everything OK at home?” I’ve had this question asked of me a few times at school, normally when I was flunking something. 

“It depends on how you define ‘OK’.”

“What do you mean?”

“My father provides for us all, but we only see him at weekends, but he and my mother generally spend weekends away. ‘Rekindling the old fires’, or something. My mother dotes after our little brother, but treats Tasha like a robot. When she eventually gets home from whatever brunch she’s attending, she’s got Tasha learning languages, piano, violin. She only gets free time at weekends, when the parents are away and it’s just me and her. Plus our brother, but he goes to bed quite early, so it’s just us.. chilling.”

“And you get on well with your sister?” 

“Of course, we’re very close, always have been.” He nods, but there’s a hint of something in his expression I’m not 100% comfortable with.

“She speaks very highly of you, you know. I surmised as much about your family situation from what your sister told me. If there’s anything I can say positively about your... situation is that despite appearances, you have a very stable household, and Tasha is thriving. You know she’s been pre-accepted for university?” I nod.

“She’s a veritable sponge for information, and despite appearances, what your mother is doing will hold her in very good stead for the future. As long as she does indeed get some free time?" the sentence ended as a question.

“Oh, yeah. She’s free to do what she wants at weekends, but she generally spends them at friends’ houses”

“Like Amanda?”

“Yes, quite often”

“Good, good. They’re quite alike, those two. Probably why they hit it off so quickly. How is she, by the way? I understand she was the one who...”

“Yes, she’s... better. She was fairly shaken up but I think I, I mean she’s calmed down a lot.”

Suddenly, there’s a knock on the door, but before the headmaster can respond the door bursts open and Amanda comes rushing in, in her full uniform, and throws herself towards me as I stand up. She’s sobbing again, and I wrap my arms around her like before and try to comfort her as much as possible.

“Sorry headmaster, but she’s in no fit state to continue here today.” I’m assuming the woman at the door is one of her teachers.

“I don’t know why she came back at all after what happened.” She stares daggers at me so I feel pressured to defend myself.

“I called earlier and was told Amanda had to come back to classes” The woman and the headmaster exchange a look. I think someone’s overstepped the mark (receptionist, I reckon). He comes over to us and puts a hand on her shoulder.

“Amanda, take the rest of the week off. You need time to recover from this. Don’t worry about your  school work, I’m sure we can figure something out.” She nods her head against my chest, her teacher hands me her bag, the headmaster thanks me for our talk. He doesn’t seem like a bad type, despite the stuffiness of the surroundings. I shift Amanda to my side and we walk back out to the car. A few pupils come up to us and whisper to her, she nods and briefly holds their hands as we pass.

I help her back into the passenger seat, and once I get in and close the door, she’s off again.

“Hey, hey. What did I say earlier? Tasha’s fine.” But she looks at me with tears streaming down her face.

“My hockey stick has still got her blood on it” We sit in the car for a bit as she calms down. I’m fuming they didn’t at least clean the blood away, but we can bollock the school about that later. I ask her where she wants to go, but it’s only just afternoon and no-one’s home. 

“Do your parents know what’s happened?” She shakes her head and pulls her phone out of her bag. She taps a few buttons on the screen but quickly stifles a sob and hands the phone to me.

“You tell them, I can’t” Awkward again. I manage to introduce myself to her mother, tell her what’s happened, she sounds more concerned for Tasha than my mother did. She sounds a little annoyed that her daughter’s been given two days off school, as she probably can’t get the time off work at short notice without pissing off her boss. I offer to look after Amanda until the normal time she gets home, just to ease the obvious tension. Her mother seems a little wary, but I tell her we’ll probably go back up the hospital anyway. She says thank you and I hang up.

“Right, I’m looking after you for the rest of the day, then I’ll take you home later. Sound ok?” She smiles and nods. The drive home is a little more cheerful. Knowing she’s got a couple of days off school has probably lifted her spirits, so we talk bollocks until I pull into our driveway. 

I let Amanda into the house and point her towards the living room. I pick up the hallway phone and call the hospital and ask to speak to Tasha, surprisingly, they put me through (Most private wards have phones these days. Progress for ya).

“Amanda’s with me, she couldn’t handle being back at school so she’s got a couple of days off”

“Didn’t you take her home?”

“No-one home until later, I spoke to her mother, I’m looking after her for a few hours until they get home.”

“That’s really sweet of you. Tell her if she needs anything she knows where my stuff is. Tell her to help herself”

“OK, thanks. We’ll get sorted and come back over to see you”

“Leave it a couple of hours, mum’s telling everyone how to do their job and I, apparently, need a nap.”

“Where’s Tommy (baby brother)?”

“She’s dropped him off at Aunt Xxxxx’s house, She’s having him overnight.”

“Ok, cool. We’ll wait a couple of hours then come up”

“Ok, my body will be waiting” 

“Pardon??” Concussed and still a wise-arse

“I’m just kidding, stupid.” Her voice drops to a whisper “But I still want you”

“I know, Love you sis”

“Love you” We hang up. I go through to the living room and Amanda’s sitting on the sofa, staring at her hands. 

“Tea?” She gives me a soggy smile and nods.

“We’ll go up the hospital in a couple of hours, Tasha’s having a sleep, so we’ve got some time to kill.” I point to a bookcase stacked with DVDs and Blu-rays.

“Unless you’re a Jeremy Kyle fan, there’s bugger all on TV so you can pick one to watch if you like.”

“Got any Twilight?” I give her a look, she cracks a wobbly smile. "Kidding!" She gets up to peruse the shelves and I walk to the kitchen to put the kettle on. After about a minute she calls through.

“What’s ‘Inner Space’?” I’ve finished the tea so bring the mugs through. I hand her her cup and take the DVD case off her. 

“Christ, I haven’t watched this in years. This film’s older than me. 80’s, old school. Practical effects, none of this CGI bollocks they cram into every movie these days. The effects should compliment the film, not tell the story for it.”

“You sound like an old man!” 

“It’s my dad’s fault. Most of these are his, and most of them are older films…” I put the film on and we sit on the sofa to watch it, but we’re still discussing movies for so long (she’s taking media studies at school) that we actually miss the first 10 minutes so I have to start again.
 
“Ugh! Sorry, I should have said I don’t take sugar”

“Sorry, My fault. Tasha does so I thought.. never mind, I’ll get you another one.” I return with her unsweetened tea to notice she’s taken her socks and shoes off, and curled up on one end of the sofa straight in front of the TV. I hand her her cup again and move to sit on one of the single chairs.

“I don’t bite.” She motions towards the other end of her sofa (It’s a 3-seater, so there’s room to spare, but I sit a respectable distance away. I think she doesn’t want to be in a sterile environment) We sit in silence watching the movie. I honestly haven’t seen it in about 5 years but it’s all flooding back to me now. After a while I happen to look over to Amanda and her head’s resting on the side of the sofa. I can’t see her eyes so I can’t tell if she’s fallen asleep.
