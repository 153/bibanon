**The Liliad** was a story about a basement dweller, and his love for a loli, named Lily. The story is very, very feels-dense. It seemed to be deliberately written to induce hope, and then in the final installment, took a turn that was even worse than the very worst fears of its readers, inverting both the tone and message of the story within a few posts. 

### Lily
Lily was described as half-Asian, half-white, and as presenting with the best of both sides. OP flatly refused to post any pictures of her, probably because it's stupid to post pictures to /b/. However, OP's signature picture was one of [Kiernan Shipka](http://fuuka.worldathleticproject.org/boards/b/image/1381/64/1381640412301.jpghttp://fuuka.worldathleticproject.org/boards/b/image/1381/64/1381640412301.jpg), suggesting that Lily at least somewhat resembles her.
